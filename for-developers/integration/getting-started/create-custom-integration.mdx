The following steps will guide you through creating a custom integration for an external service.

## Prerequisites
- A Botpress Cloud workspace.
  - The workspace handle must be set. Follow these [instructions](../../../guides/getting-started.mdx) to create and setup your workspace.
  - The integration limit for your workspace has not been reached.
- The development environment is set up and the Botpress CLI is installed. Follow these [instructions](../../guides/getting-started.mdx) to install the necessary tools.
- A personal access token (PAT) is configured for your workspace. Follow these [instructions](../../../guides/getting-started.mdx) to create a PAT.
## Create your integration project
<Steps>
  <Step title="Login">
  Start by logging into your Botpress Cloud workspace. This allows the CLI to create the integration with the correct workspace handle. Use the following command:
  ```bash
  npm exec bp login
  ```

  <Step title="Initialize your project">
  Create a new integration project. Use the command below to start the project creation wizard. When prompted, select the `integration` project type, then
  select the workspace you want to create the integration in and finally select the integration template you want to use (select `Empty Integration` to start from scratch):
  ```bash
  npm exec bp init
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
