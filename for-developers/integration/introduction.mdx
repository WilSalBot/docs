Integrations in Botpress extend a bot's functionality by connecting it to external services. They act as intermediaries, handling events between Botpress and external systems.

Integrations are built around handlers that process events, triggering actions within Botpress or the external service.
## Key Capabilities of Integrations
### Channels
Channels represent entities of the external service where conversations take place between users and bots. A channel might correspond to conversations in a chat application, comment threads in a social media platform, or other communication mediums.
### Actions
Actions are functions that bots can invoke to perform tasks in external services. For instance, a bot might call an action to update a to-do list item, retrieve data from an external API, or modify the status of a task in a project management tool.
### Events
Events are notifications sent from an external service to Botpress, informing the platform about specific activities or changes. Examples include a new customer order in an e-commerce platform or a file upload to cloud storage.
## Integration Access and Hosting
An integration is associated with a workspace and is private by default. It can also be made public and shared with the broader Botpress community. Public integrations are available on the [Botpress Hub](https://botpress.com/hub).

Integrations are hosted free of charge on Botpress infrastructure, but they can also be [self-hosted](./how-tos/self-host.mdx).
